## Notes
- Start out with implementing the personal portion of the application
- Personal users need an id, first name, last name, email, password, badminton matches ids, drill ids, and physical ids.
- Badminton Matches should have the ability for users to input up to 3 games. These matches require two players, and the title of the matches will be
"Player 1 vs Player 2". By default the first player should be the user of the application. However, it may be beneficial to have the ability to change the first player to another individual.
Perhaps this could encourage tracking performance of a small group of friends and allow for some flexibility.
- Use MongoDB for basic database procedures...
